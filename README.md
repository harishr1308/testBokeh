Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

To get started using Bokeh to make your visualizations, see the [User Guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html#userguide).

To see examples of how you might use Bokeh with your own data, check out the [Gallery](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html#gallery).

A complete API reference of Bokeh is at [Reference Guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference.html#refguide).

If you are interested in contributing to Bokeh, or extending the library, see the [Developer Guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide.html#devguide).
